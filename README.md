Only thing I'm missing for this game is the actual GUI. Just have the console
version.

Game is player vs computer matching up domino numbers. The goal for both the player and the computer
is to have the least amount of dominos by the end of the game session.
- If both the computer and the human have taken all the dominos out of the boneyard, then the game
  checks whether they have any valid moves left if not.
- Once this occurs, each players trays domino numbers are counted and if they have domino's remaining in them.
- The one with the least amount is the winner.

* If you do play, when placing dominos the list will get shifted. Since both the computer and you place them
  into one list, the stack moves. In other words, sometimes the domino you placed will be on top, and perhaps
  after a couple moves it may be on the bottom. Just something to keep in mind, but you can still place domino's
  at the top of the list or the bottom.
